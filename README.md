# APEX Arbitrage System

> Multi-chain, ML-guided, flashloan-powered MEV arbitrage execution architecture

## 🎯 Overview

APEX is a high-performance arbitrage system that combines machine learning prediction with ultra-low-latency transaction execution across multiple blockchain networks. The system uses TypeScript for orchestration, Python for AI/ML inference, and Rust for high-speed transaction execution.

### Key Features

- **Multi-chain Support**: Polygon, Ethereum, BSC, and more
- **ML-Powered**: Real-time opportunity scoring using trained neural networks
- **Flashloan Integration**: Balancer, Aave, Curve, and DODO protocols
- **High Performance**: Rust-based execution engine for minimal latency

## 📚 Documentation

For detailed information about the system, please refer to:

- **[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System architecture, components, and execution flow
- **[Project Structure](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)** - Detailed directory structure and component details
- **[Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Deployment, monitoring, testing, and security guidelines

## 🚀 Quick Start

git clone https://github.com/fxgeniusllc-oss/NEW_ARB-.git
cd NEW_ARB-

# Run automated installation and startup
./scripts/install-and-run.sh
```

**Windows:**
```batch
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fxgeniusllc-oss/NEW_ARB-.git
cd NEW_ARB-

# Run automated installation and startup
scripts\install-and-run.bat
```

#### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fxgeniusllc-oss/NEW_ARB-.git
cd NEW_ARB-

# Install TypeScript dependencies
yarn install

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r python/requirements.txt

# Build Rust modules
cd rust && cargo build --release
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# RPC Endpoints
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR-API-KEY

# Wallet Configuration
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Gas Settings
MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=100
MIN_PROFIT_USD=5

# ML Server
ML_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Mode
EXECUTION_MODE=SIM  # Use 'LIVE' for production
```

### Running the System

#### Start ML Inference Server

```bash
cd python
python main.py
```

#### Run Scanner in Simulation Mode

```bash
yarn start:sim
```

#### Run Full System

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Python ML server
cd python && python main.py

# Terminal 2: Run TypeScript orchestrator
yarn start
```

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### End-to-End Validation

The system includes comprehensive end-to-end validation:

```bash
# Quick validation test (simulation mode)
npm run build
EXECUTION_MODE=SIM \
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com \
PRIVATE_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
ML_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
node dist/index.js
```

See [VALIDATION_QUICKSTART.md](VALIDATION_QUICKSTART.md) for detailed validation instructions.

The validation system tests:
- ✅ Data fetch from multiple DEXes
- ✅ Arbitrage opportunity detection and calculation
- ✅ ML-powered opportunity scoring
- ✅ Transaction payload building and signing
- ✅ MEV protection with Merkle trees (BloxRoute/QuickNode/Flashbots)
- ✅ Transaction broadcasting to blockchain

### Integration Source Audit

Run comprehensive audits to ensure code quality and prevent regressions:

```bash
# Run full integration audit
./scripts/audit-integration.sh

# Run performance benchmarks
./scripts/performance-benchmark.sh
```

The audit framework validates:
- ✅ Environment compatibility (Node.js, Python, Rust)
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities and best practices
- ✅ Code structure and organization
- ✅ Test coverage and quality
- ✅ Documentation completeness
- ✅ Dependency management
- ✅ Performance benchmarks

For detailed information, see:
- **[Integration Audit Documentation](docs/INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md)** - Complete audit framework guide
- **[QA Guide](docs/QA_GUIDE.md)** - Quality assurance best practices

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions automatically runs:
- Integration source audits on every push
- Performance benchmarks weekly
- Security vulnerability scans
- Dependency audits

Check the **Actions** tab for CI/CD status and reports.
