## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Never commit private keys or sensitive credentials
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Test thoroughly in simulation mode before live deployment
- Monitor gas prices and set appropriate limits
- Implement circuit breakers for risk management
- Use secure RPC endpoints
- Consider using MEV protection services (Flashbots, Eden)
