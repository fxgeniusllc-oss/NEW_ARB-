# Quality Assurance Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for maintaining code quality, ensuring no regressions, and maintaining top global performance compatibilities for the APEX Arbitrage System.

## Quick Start

### Run Full Audit

```bash
# Run complete integration source audit
./scripts/audit-integration.sh

# Run performance benchmarks
./scripts/performance-benchmark.sh
```

## Audit Tools

### 1. Integration Source Audit

**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of codebase health, security, and structure.

**What it checks**:
- ✅ Environment compatibility (Node.js, Python, Rust versions)
- ✅ Code structure and organization
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Dependency management
- ✅ Test coverage
- ✅ Documentation completeness
- ✅ CI/CD configuration
- ✅ Git repository hygiene

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/audit-integration.sh
```

**Output**: Generates detailed report in `audit-reports/`

### 2. Performance Benchmark

**Purpose**: Measure and track performance across all system components.

**What it measures**:
- ⚡ TypeScript/Node.js execution speed
- ⚡ Python computation performance
- ⚡ Rust benchmark results
- ⚡ Build times
- ⚡ Memory usage
- ⚡ Network latency

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/performance-benchmark.sh
```

**Output**: Generates benchmark report in `benchmark-results/`

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying any changes:

- [ ] Run integration source audit: `./scripts/audit-integration.sh`
- [ ] All audit checks passing (no failures)
- [ ] Run performance benchmarks: `./scripts/performance-benchmark.sh`
- [ ] Performance within acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Test coverage adequate
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed by team members

## CI/CD Integration

The audit framework is integrated into GitHub Actions and runs automatically on:
- Every push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Every pull request
- Daily scheduled runs (2 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

### View Results

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in GitHub
2. Select "Integration Source Audit" workflow
3. Click on a run to see results
4. Download artifacts for detailed reports

## Development Workflow

### Before Committing

```bash
# Run quick audit
./scripts/audit-integration.sh

# Fix any failures or critical warnings
# Then commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Before Creating PR

```bash
# Run full audit suite
./scripts/audit-integration.sh

# Run performance benchmarks
./scripts/performance-benchmark.sh

# Review reports
ls audit-reports/
ls benchmark-results/

# Address any issues before submitting PR
```

### During Code Review

Reviewers should verify:
- CI audit status (should be green ✅)
- No new security vulnerabilities introduced
- Performance regressions within acceptable ranges
- Test coverage maintained or improved

## Troubleshooting

### Audit Script Issues

**Problem**: Script fails to execute
```bash
# Solution: Ensure it's executable
chmod +x scripts/audit-integration.sh
```

**Problem**: Environment checks fail
```bash
# Solution: Install required tools
# Node.js >= 16.x
nvm install 16

# Python >= 3.8
sudo apt-get install python3.8

# Rust >= 1.70
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Performance Benchmark Issues

**Problem**: Inconsistent benchmark results
```bash
# Solution: Close background applications and run on dedicated hardware
# Ensure system is not under load
top
free -h
```

## Best Practices

### Code Quality

1. **Write Tests First**: TDD approach ensures comprehensive coverage
2. **Document Public APIs**: Keep documentation in sync with code
3. **Review Security**: Always consider security implications
4. **Profile Performance**: Measure before optimizing
5. **Use Linters**: Follow language-specific style guides

### Security

1. **Never Commit Secrets**: Use environment variables
2. **Rotate Credentials**: If exposed, rotate immediately
3. **Audit Dependencies**: Regularly check for vulnerabilities
4. **Review .gitignore**: Ensure sensitive files excluded
5. **Use Security Tools**: Leverage automated scanning

### Performance

1. **Set Budgets**: Define acceptable performance thresholds
2. **Monitor Trends**: Track performance over time
3. **Optimize Critical Paths**: Focus on hot code paths
4. **Profile First**: Don't guess, measure
5. **Test Under Load**: Simulate production conditions

## Performance Targets
